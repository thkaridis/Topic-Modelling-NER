# Topic-Modelling-NER

We will be using some papers from the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) conference. NIPS is a machine learning conference.
You can download the data from Sam Roweis' website:

• Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Introducing basic text processing methods such as tokenisation, stop word removal, stemming and vectorising text via term frequencies (TF) as well as the inverse document frequencies (TF-IDF)

• Topic Modelling with LDA – Experimenting with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Experiment with the different parameters (number of topics, alpha parameter, etc.).
